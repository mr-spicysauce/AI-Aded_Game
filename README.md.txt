==========About==========
=

This is an AI aided game as I can not code at all.

The AI I am using to help me code this game is https://chat.openai.com/chat

I am trying to make the AI do as much of coding as possible to see how far I can push its limits!

Right now the code split is about 60% AI and 40% Human!

==========How to download and test==========
=

Because the open AI chatbot is trained on info from 2021 I am using an older version of Godot.

I have not tested new versions, but I assume it will break so please download Godot 3.4.5.

Both windows and Linux versions are on this page: https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.4.5/

And to play the game download the files from git and extract them.

open Godot and import a new project and navigate to the extracted game files.

Select "project.godot" and import and edit.

Once the editor is open just press the play button in the top right or press F5.

And now you have the game open and ready to play.

To get new versions of the game it's exactly the same just replace the old files with the new ones.
